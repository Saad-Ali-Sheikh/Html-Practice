<p>Web development is defined as the work process that goes into creating and managing a website either for the World Wide Web, or for a private network/intranet. The work that goes into in can vary in magnitude, from being simple and straight forward to being a multi-faceted venture of combining a complicated mixture of various web-based internet applications and social network services.
Few of the main tasks that web development covers are:
Web designing
Client-side/server-side scripting
E-commerce development
Web server
Network security configuration
Web content development
Typically, there is a department that deals with each of these sectors individually, and there is a work-flow system in place at most software development companies.
The Change:
Before the philosophy used to be the more the better, the more extensive a website was, the better. Sites were chock full of videos, photos and other such features, and that is what impressed users.
But now times have changed…
Not it’s all about a site being refined, something that goes almost unnoticed by the common users.</p> 
<p>Websites today work on being more aesthetically pleasing and interactively smoother than those of the past. An important element allowing for such an evolution is the self-development of web technologies that has granted the web developers the ability to produce various new generations of useful and immersive web experiences. The ongoing efforts of the general web community that have helped in defining the web technologies like HTML5, CSS3 and WebGL in the first place have developed new processes and systems to make sure that all these features are supported in all the web browsers used regularly by the users.
The evolution in web designing has cause web development to become much more personal, as per the demands and needs of various customers. Since people have started taking a greater interest in their web campaigns, web developers have learned to be far more adaptive in their programming.
In the 1990s, designing was done such that deigning and aesthetics were given hierarchy over accessibility. Newer features such as CSS were introduced to enhance both the accessibility and the professional outlook for the websites. Flash also came through during the same time period to enhance the development of animations and grant greater options to the general public in this regard.
Mobile computing however is by far the biggest change that has occurred in web development. Cell phones have transformed from being a simple calling device to one of the most powerful and resourceful devices of the century. They are now able to send and receive data from all over the world. Newer cell phone generations, those integrated with 3G or 4G networks are responsible for a faster form of data transfer and also allow their users to use Internet while on the go.</p>

			<p>Among web professionals, "web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building websites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.For larger organizations and businesses, web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing websites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer. Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.</p>

			<p>Since the commercialization of the web, web development has been a growing industry. The growth of this industry is being driven by businesses wishing to use their website to advertise and sell products and services to customers.[3There are many open source tools for web development such as BerkeleyDB, GlassFish, LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and Perl/Plack. This has kept the cost of learning web development to a minimum. Another contributing factor to the growth of the industry has been the rise of easy-to-use WYSIWYG web-development software, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and Microsoft Visual Studio. Knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or of programming languages is still required to use such software, but the basics can be learned and implemented quickly.An ever-growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers build more dynamic and interactive websites. Further, web developers now help to deliver applications as web services which were traditionally only available as applications on a desk-based computer. This has allowed for many opportunities .</p>
